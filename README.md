# Flask_URL_analyzer_ML
This is my capstone project. If you would like to be able to run the project, I highly recommend downloading the file from the google drive link [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R7gFTvLdvh6oJPSDnZsIoY2dvDetugzj/view?usp=drive_link)
This is a zipped file because the machine learning model alone was very large, by itself. To view the code that was used in creating the final model, you would go to "model_info" > "model_creation_files" which will output the exact model used in the machine learning project.
Testing the model should output an accuracy of approximately 96% with the given dataset, but improvements will be made in the future for a higher accuracy with real-world input.
Not shown in this repository are the steps taken to host the project on Azure as a functioning web application.
